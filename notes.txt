Some features I have in mind:
Change the photo interval (this is easy to do, but making a UI for it is terrible)
Auto detect when you're at home/work vs. out, and have different intervals for each (Latitude has this knowledge, but not the Latitude API)
Scaling down images so they can be taken more often, but not take up as much space (and maybe having a buffer where bad photos are deleted)
